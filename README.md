# LANDS (Large Area Nanoparticle Deposition System)
A project by __M. Greyson Christoforo__  

This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship grant agreement No 659667.

This repository contains the mechanical and electrical design files for a three-axis air-atomizing spray nozzle positioner with a heated stage and syringe pump which can be dynamically generated to fit user specified dimensions.
