#DRV8711EVM
the big stepper motor eval kit from TI  
- DRV8711 has 3.3v logic

Buspirate settings for sinffing:
`m-5-2-1-1-1-1-1-(2)`

The bus pirate SPI bus sniffed trace for a "proper setup" using the TI provided EVM gui tool (matching my scereen grabs) is:  
`[0x0F(0xFF)][0x11(0xFF)][0x11(0xFF)][0x7B(0xFF)][0x20(0xFF)][0x32(0xFF)][0x31(0xFF)][0x00(0xFF)][0x45(0xFF)][0x10(0xFF)][0x5A(0xFF)][0x02(0xFF)][0x60(0xFF)][0x00(0xFF)`

So just the sends were:
```
[0x0F 0x11]
[0x11 0x7B]
[0x20 0x32]
[0x31 0x00]
[0x45 0x10]
[0x5A 0x02]
[0x60 0x00]
```
or with no breaks: 
`0x0F11117B2032310045105A026000`

Then the trace for the read out using the official gui of these settings is:  
`[0x80(0x8F)][0x00(0x11)][0x90(0x81)][0x00(0x7B)][0xA0(0x80)][0x00(0x32)][0xB0(0x81)][0x00(0x00)][0xC0(0x85)][0x00(0x10)][0xD0(0x8A)][0x00(0x02)][0xE0(0x80)][0x00(0x00)`  

Buspirate settings for writing:  
`m-5-2-1-1-1-1-1-W-e-2-P`
Then we can program the part:
```
[0x0F 0x11][0x11 0x7B][0x20 0x32][0x31 0x00][0x45 0x10][0x5A 0x02][0x60 0x00]
```
