#DRV8711EVM
the big stepper motor eval kit from TI  
- DRV8711 has 3.3v logic

For sniffing with bus pirate:
inputs:
m-5-2-1-1-1-1-1-(2)

The bus pirate trace for a "proper setup" (matching my scereen grabs) is:
```
[0x0F(0xFF)][0x11(0xFF)]
[0x11(0xFF)][0x7B(0xFF)]
[0x20(0xFF)][0x32(0xFF)]
[0x31(0xFF)][0x00(0xFF)]
[0x45(0xFF)][0x10(0xFF)]
[0x5A(0xFF)][0x02(0xFF)]
[0x60(0xFF)][0x00(0xFF)
```
Which is really:
```
[0x0F 0x11]
[0x11 0x7B]
[0x20 0x32]
[0x31 0x00]
[0x45 0x10]
[0x5A 0x02]
[0x60 0x00]
```
or with no breaks: 
`0x0F11117B2032310045105A026000`
